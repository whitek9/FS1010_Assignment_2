## Please include:
[x] Users type in the input field and press enter
[x] When they press enter, use the input value and add it as a list item to the unordered list under the input field.
[ ] When a user clicks on a list item, the checkbox should fill. And text should turn grey to indicate that it has been "done."

## Helpful Tips:
[x] Start with a "document ready"
[x] Research "event binding" in jQuery
[x] You will have to "prevent default" behaviour
[x] Use concatenation to add HTML elements. KW: found the createTextNode/appendChild methods and used those

## Optional Extra's to Add:
*These are only suggestions and things you can add to improve your application or make it more complex.*

[ ] Allow the removal of items completely from the list
[ ] Automatically move completed items to the bottom
[x] Error if input is empty

## Advanced Things to Try:
[ ] Drag/drop sort items (have a look at jQuery UI)
[x] When the page loads focus on the input field (i.e. cursor should load inside input, ready to type)
